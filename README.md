Memory-Game

A memory card game designed with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Currently the game can only be played on a desktop browser. Mobile phone versions will be designed shortly.

The game works like any ordinary memory game except it is designed specifically for two-player mode. Players take turns turning over cards to find a match. If a player finds a pair of matching cards they can get another turn until they turn over two cards that do not match.

Why HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript

In my two years of studying Computer Science at the university level, I have only made use of Java and Python programming languages. Despite recently taking a course on mobile app development, we are yet to actually be introduced to any programming language frameworks such as React.js that would have been more suitable for this application. 

During this past week I had to learn JavaScript from scratch as well as dive far deeper than I ever have into CSS in order to complete the application with a certain level of proficiency. Despite it being really hectic, I am glad I experienced this as it was not only fun but it has made me realize how far behind I am in actual software development. I am motivated to further enhance the skills I have learnt over the week and hope to significantly improve the app such that it is scalable between different devices and meets the design specification exactly.

INSTALLATION and HOW TO USE:

Due to the game being a desktop browser app, no installation is required. The game is not yet live but I plan on publishing it under a domain name shortly. To launch the game, the index.html file can be run via any browser.

In a devloper's point of view. The code is fairly straightforward and includes documentation wherever there are ambiguities.
